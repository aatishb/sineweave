title: WaveTable
category: object
blurb: |
  `WaveTable(size)` is a class that creates a wave table object. A wave table is implemented in synthesine as a circular buffer. This is an array where we can shift the point at which we start reading from. Wave tables are used in simulating musical instruments.

  `new WaveTable(size);` creates a new empty wave table.

  `size (optional)` This sets the size of the array, and can be any positive integer.

  `WaveTable` is an extension of `Wave`, which is itself an extension of javascript's built-in `Float32Array`, so it inherits all the [Float32Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array). For example, `new WaveTable().fill(0.1)` will create a new Wave Table filled with the value 0.1

  ##### Wave Table Manipulation Functions
  - `.delay(n)` shifts the current position of the wave table by `n` samples, and returns the wave table. For a full audio cycle, use 128 (i.e. `numSamples`) for `n`.

  - `.set(array)` sets the next 128 values of the wave table to the entries of `array`. The wave table is rewritten in a circular fashion, starting from the current position.

  - `.get()` returns the next 128 values of the wave table, starting from the current position.


  ##### Wave Manipulation Functions

  - `.add` adds two waves together
  - `.sub` subtracts one wave from another
  - `.mult` multiples two waves or multiplies a wave with a number
  - `.div` divides two waves or divides a wave with a number
  - `.modulate` modulates one wave with another wave
  - `.map` applies any function onto the wave entries

let wave;

function setup() {
  wave = new WaveTable(500).map((e,i) => i/500);
}

function loop() {
  wave.delay(128);
  return wave.get().mult(0.1);
}
