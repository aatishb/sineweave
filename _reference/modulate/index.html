blurb: |
  `modulate` is a function associated with the `Wave` class that lets you modulate the amplitude (i.e. the loudness) of one wave using another wave.

  `wave1.modulate(wave2)` creates a new wave whose entries are `wave1[i] * (1 + wave2[i])`. This is used in Amplitude Modulation.

  Note that `wave1` and `wave2` must be the same length for this to be properly defined.

let wave1, wave2;

function setup() {
}

function loop() {

  wave1 = time.map(sin(440));
  wave2 = time.map(square(5));

  return wave1.modulate(wave2).mult(0.1);
}
