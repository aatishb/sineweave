blurb: |
  `map` is a function associated with the `Wave` class that lets you apply any function you want to transform a wave.

  For example, `wave.map(() => 0)` would fill the wave with zeroes, and `wave.map(() => Math.random())` would fill the wave with random numbers, generating white noise.

  In addition to generating a wave, you can also distort or filter a wave with a map function. For example, `wave.map(e => e * e)`, squares the value of each element, and `wave.map(e => Math.abs(e))` takes the absolute value of each element. In general, `map` allows you to build any effect you like, and all the other wave manipulation functions are built using this function.
