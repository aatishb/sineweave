blurb: |
  `add` is a function associated with the `Wave` class that lets you add two waves together.

  `wave1.add(wave2)` creates a new wave whose entries are the point-wise sum of the waves `wave1` and `wave2`. Note that `wave1` and `wave2` must be the same length for the sum to be properly defined.

let wave1, wave2;

function setup() {
}

function loop() {
  wave1 = time.map(sin(200));
  wave2 = time.map(sin(300));

  return wave1
    .add(wave2)
    .mult(0.1);
}
