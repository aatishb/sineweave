blurb: |
  The classic [Karplus-Strong Algorithm](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/MusicAndComputers/chapter4/04_09.php) for simulating the sound of a guitar string. Start with a random wave filled with white noise. Now loop a delay followed by a smoothing average.

let amp = 0.1;
let noiseWave;
let average = twoPointAverage();

function setup() {
  noiseWave = new Wave().map(whiteNoise).mult(amp);
}

function loop() {
  noiseWave = noiseWave.map(average.apply);
  return noiseWave;
}
