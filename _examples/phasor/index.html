category: oscillator
blurb: |
  A phasor is a wave that rises linearly from 0 to 1 at a steady frequency. Once it reaches 1, it goes back to zero. It's essentially a sawtooth wave.

  It's useful for shaping sounds, as shown in the [polynomial](https://aatishb.com/synthfromscratch/examples/polynomial/index.html) example. What happens to the wave if you square the output of the phasor? (Remember to lower the volume by multiplying the wave down at the end.)

let freq = 440;
let amp = 0.1;

function setup() {
}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(phasor(freq))
    .mult(amp);
}
