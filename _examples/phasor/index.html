title: Phasor
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  A phasor is a wave that rises from 0 to 1, and repeats at a steady frequency. It's like a sawtooth wave, except always positive.

  It's useful for shaping sounds, as shown in the [polynomial](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/polynomial/index.html) example.

  What happens to the wave if you square the output of the phasor? (Remember to lower the volume by multiplying the wave down at the end.)

let freq = 440;
let amp = 0.1;

function setup() {
}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(phasor(freq))
    .mult(amp);
}
