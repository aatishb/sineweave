blurb: |
  A simple physical waveguide model of a wind instrument. This is essentially the same as the guitar string model, but we start with an empty wave instead, and add noise to it in each loop.

let wave, noise, filter;

function setup() {
  wave = new Wave();
  filter = twoPointAverage();
}

function loop() {

  noise = noiseWave().mult(0.1);
  wave = wave.add(noise).map(filter.apply);

  return wave.mult(0.05);
}
