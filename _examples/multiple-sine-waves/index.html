title: Adding Sine Waves
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Three sine waves are added together to create a dial-tone like sound.

  What happens if you add sine waves together that are very close to each other in frequency?

let freq = 440;
let amp = 0.1;
let myWave, myWave2, myWave3;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {
  myWave = time.map(sin(freq));
  myWave2 = time.map(sin(1.5 * freq));
  myWave3 = time.map(sin(1.25 * freq));

  return myWave
    .add(myWave2)
    .add(myWave3)
    .mult(amp);
}
