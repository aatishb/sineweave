title: Amplitude Modulation
category: modulation
blurb: |
  In amplitude modulation, we use a wave to modulate (vary) the amplitude of another wave. So here we have a signal, a 440 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.1. And we have a 'carrier wave', a slow 1 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.5.

  Modulating this signal with this carrier means the amplitude of the output varies by 50%, at a 1 Hz frequency (once a second).

  You could implement this from scratch like this:

  ```javascript
  function loop() {

    carrier = time.map(sin(1)).mult(0.5);
    signal = time.map(sin(440)).mult(0.1);

    signal = signal.map((e,i) => e * (1 + carrier[i]));

    return signal;
  }
  ```

  To make this easier to implement, we've added in a modulate function, defined as:

  ```javascript
  Float32Array.prototype.modulate = function(carrier) {
    return this.map((e,i) => e * (1 + carrier[i]));
  };
  ```

  so you can just write `signal.modulate(carrier)`

let carrier, signal;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  carrier = time.map(sin(1)).mult(0.5);
  signal = time.map(sin(440)).mult(0.1);

  signal = signal.modulate(carrier);

  return signal;
}
