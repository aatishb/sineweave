title: Amplitude Modulation
category: modulation
blurb: |
  Amplitude Moduation (AM) refers to using a wave to set the volume of another wave. We start with a signal (a 440 Hz sine wave) and a 'carrier wave', here a 5 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.5. Modulating the signal with this carrier means that the amplitude of the signal varies by 50%, five times a second.

  What happens as you increase the frequency of the carrier wave? How does the character of the sound change?

  What happens if instead of using a sine wave as the carrier wave, you use one of the other oscillators (saw, triangle, square)?

let carrierWave;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  carrierWave = sinWave(5).mult(0.5);

  return sinWave(440)
    .modulate(carrierWave)
    .mult(0.1);
}
