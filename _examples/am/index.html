title: Amplitude Modulation
category: modulation
blurb: |
  Amplitude Moduation, or AM, refers to using a wave to vary (modulate) the volume of another wave. Let's start with a signal, here a 440 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.1. And let's add a 'carrier wave', here a slowly varying 1 Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.5. Modulating the signal with this carrier means that the amplitude of the signal goes up and down by 50% once a second.

  You could implement this from scratch like this:

  ```javascript
  function loop() {
    carrier = time.map(sin(1)).mult(0.5);
    signal = time.map(sin(440)).mult(0.1);

    return signal.map((e,i) => e * (1 + carrier[i]));
  }
  ```

  To make this easier to implement, we've added in a modulate function, defined as:

  ```javascript
  Float32Array.prototype.modulate = function(carrier) {
    return this.map((e,i) => e * (1 + carrier[i]));
  };
  ```

  so you can write `signal.modulate(carrier)`

let carrier, signal;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  carrier = time.map(sin(1)).mult(0.5);
  signal = time.map(sin(440)).mult(0.1);

  signal = signal.modulate(carrier);

  return signal;
}
