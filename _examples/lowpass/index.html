title: Low Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character. A low pass filter leaves low frequencies unaffected, and filters out high frequencies. Low pass filters are used everywhere that you need to smooth out the jitters from noisy real-world data, like the gyroscope or acceleration sensors in smartphones. We can call it as `lowPass(a)` where the parameter `a` is called the cutoff and can range between 0 and 1. This cutoff determines the frequency spectrum of the low pass filter.

  What happens to the spectrum as you change the cutoff?

  Mathematically, a low pass filter can be expressed as `output[i] = alpha * input[i] +  (1 - alpha) * output[i - 1]`. This type of low pass filter is sometimes also called a one-zero filter.

  In this library, it's defined like this:
  ```javascript
  const lowPass = alpha => (input, output, i) => {
    return ( alpha * input[i] +  (1 - alpha) * output[i - 1] )
      || input[i];
  };
  ```

let amp = 0.05;
let cutoff = 0.1;

function setup() {
  slider('cutoff', 0.01, 1, 0.01);
}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(lowPass(cutoff))
    .mult(amp);
}
