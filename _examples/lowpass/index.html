title: Low Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character. A low pass filter leaves low frequencies unaffected, and filters out high frequencies.

  It's a very simple, efficient one-line algorithm, and is used everywhere that you need to smooth out some noisy real-world data (e.g. the gyroscopes and accelerometers in smartphones).

  It's defined like this:
  ```javascript
  const lowPass = alpha => (input, output, i) => {
    return ( alpha * input[i] +  (1 - alpha) * output[i - 1] )
      || input[i];
  };
  ```

  What happens to the spectrum as you change the parameter of the lowPass filter?

  Remember that the parameter is only a low pass filter for values between 0 and 1.

let amp = 0.05;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(lowPass(0.1))
    .mult(amp);
}
