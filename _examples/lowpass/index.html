title: Low Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character. A low pass filter leaves low frequencies unaffected, and filters out high frequencies. Low pass filters are used everywhere that you need to smooth out the jitters from noisy real-world data, like the gyroscope or acceleration sensors in smartphones. It takes in a cutoff parameter, which controls how strongly it filters out high frequencies.

  What happens to the spectrum as you change the cutoff?

  Mathematically, a low pass filter can be expressed as `y[i] = a * x[i] +  (1 - a) * y[i - 1]`, where a is a number between 0 and 1. This type of low pass filter is sometimes also called a one-zero filter.

let amp = 0.05;
let cutoff = 0.1;
let filter;

function setup() {
  slider('cutoff', 0.01, 1, 0.01);
  filter = new lowPass(cutoff);
}

function loop() {

  filter.set(cutoff);

  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(filter)
    .mult(amp);
}
