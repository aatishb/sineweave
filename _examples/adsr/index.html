blurb: |
  An envelope takes a sound and makes its amplitude (loudness) change in a desired way. An [ADSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_(ADSR)_envelope) (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope is a commonly used envelope to fade in, hold, and fade out a sound.

  Try varying the ADSR parameters. The first number refers to when the envelop begins.

  What happens if you apply an ADSR envelope to white noise?

let sine, envelope;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  sine = time.map(sin(300)).mult(0.5);
  envelope = time.map(adsr(0, 0.001, 0.05, 0.05, 0.5));

  return sine.mult(envelope);
}
