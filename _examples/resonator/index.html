title: Band Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  A band pass filter, or a resonator, allows us a narrow range of frequencies to survive, and filters out the rest. Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character.

  What happens as you vary the frequency of this band pass filter? What kind of natural sound does this resemble?

let q = 0.99, freq = 2000;

function setup() {
  slider('q', 0, 0.99, 0.01);
  slider('freq', 20, 20000, 1);
}

function loop() {

  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .mult(0.05)
    .applyFilter(resonator(freq, q));
}
