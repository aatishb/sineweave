category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Here, white noise is implemented as a series of random numbers with values ranging between -1 and 1. White noise sounds like an old radio that isn't tuned to any station. Unlike the other oscillators, white noise is equally likely to contain sounds of any frequency, and so its frequency spectrum is a flat line. This is loosely analogous to how white light is a mixture of all the different colors of light.

  To give white noise a 'color', you can use a filter, similar to how a prism can filter white light. In the filter section, we'll see how we can 'carve' white noise into a non-flat frequency spectrum, adding character to the sound.
