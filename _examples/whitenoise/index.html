category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Here, White Noise is implemented as a series of random numbers between -1 and 1. It sounds like an old radio that isn't tuned to any station. Unlike the other oscillators, white noise is equally likely to contain sounds of any frequency, and so its frequency spectrum is a flat line.

  In the filter section, we'll see how we can 'carve' white noise, to give it a non-flat frequency spectrum, adding character to the sound.
