title: Sine Wave
blurb: |
  This example creates a sine wave. The sine wave is the 'hello world' of sound.

  You can create a 440 Hz sine wave like this: `time.map(sin(440))`. The sin function also allows us to pass in an optional wave to control its phase, which we'll use to make some neat sounds in the frequency modulation section. You can add sine waves together to create any repeating sound, this is known as Fourier Synthesis, or additive synthesis.

let freq = 600;
let amp;
let dbfs = -20;

function setup() {
  slider('freq', 20, 1000, 1);
  slider('dbfs', -27, -7, 1);
}

function loop() {

  amp = Math.pow(10, dbfs/20);

  return time
    .map(sin(freq))
    .mult(amp);
}
