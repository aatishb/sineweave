title: Metal Bar
category: synthesis
blurb: |
  Simulating the sound of a struck metal bar/rod/pipe using additive synthesis. We're adding together 10 sine waves, whose amplitudes are set randomly. The decay time falls off for higher partials. The frequencies of the nth partial are set according to the formula f0 * ((2*n + 1)/3.0112)^2, where f0 is the fundamental frequency of the metal bar. Since the amplitudes are randomized, each sound has a slightly different timbre, so every time you press play the sound is slightly different.
