blurb: |
  An envelope takes a sound and makes its amplitude (loudness) change in a desired way. If we apply a decaying exponential envelope to white noise, we can recreate the sound of a shot or a cymbal crash.

  What happens if you change the decay time?

  return noiseWave().fade(0.1).mult(0.1).clip(0.1);
