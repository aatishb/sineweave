blurb: |
  An envelope takes a sound and makes its amplitude (loudness) change in a desired way. If we apply a decaying exponential envelope to white noise, we can recreate the sound of a shot or a cymbal crash.

  What happens if you change the decay time?

let noise, envelope;
let decayTime = 0.1;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  noise = time.map(whiteNoise).mult(0.1);
  envelope = time.map(t => Math.exp(- t / decayTime));

  return noise.mult(envelope).clip(0.1);
}
