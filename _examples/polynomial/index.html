blurb: |
  We start with a phasor, and then map the wave using the polynomial `-x^3 + 1.2x^2 - 0.2x` to create a custom wave shape. By changing the polynomial, you can create arbitrary wave shapes.

  What happens to the wave when you tweak the parameters in the polynomial? See if you can produce other interesting sounds.

  BE CAREFUL when using polynomials as the output can get big very fast, so you can produce all kinds of loud sounds. It's a good idea to clip your output sound to prevent this from happening. By default, this library clips sounds at 0.5 amplitude to protect your ears.

let amp = 0.2;
let freq = 440;

  return time
    .map(phasor(freq))
    .map(e => -1 * Math.pow(e,3) + 1.2 * Math.pow(e,2) - 0.2 * e)
    .clip(0.3);
}
