blurb: |
  Starting with a phasor, we map the wave using the polynomial `-x^3 + 1.2x^2 - 0.2x` to create a custom wave shape. By changing the polynomial, you can create all kinds of wave shapes.

  BE CAREFUL when using polynomials as the output can get big very fast, so you can produce all kinds of loud sounds. It's a good idea to clip your output sound to prevent this from happening. By default, this library clips sounds at 0.5 amplitude to protect your ears.

let amp = 0.2;
let freq = 440;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(phasor(freq))
    .map(e => -1 * Math.pow(e,3) + 1.2 * Math.pow(e,2) - 0.2 * e)
    .clip(0.3);
}
