title: Frequency Modulation
category: modulation
blurb: |
  Frequency Modulation (FM) is the technique that defined the sound of the 80s. FM lets you create a whole class of sounds with just two sine waves as input. In this example, we modulate the frequency of a 300 Hz sine wave signal with a new 1 Hz 'carrier' sine wave with an amplitude of 200.

  FM synthesis for sound was [introduced](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/user/jc/fm_synthesispaper-2.pdf) by John Chowning in 1973. Soon after, it was [licensed to Yamaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Ha0MMT0aA), which lead to the first wildly popular [digital synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7), and defined that classic [synth sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of the 80s.

  What happens if you turn down the modulation index, and increase the modulation frequency so that it's in the audio frequency range?

let carrier, signal;
let modulationFrequency = 1, modulationIndex = 200;
let signalFrequency = 300;

function setup() {
  slider('signalFrequency', 20, 600, 1);
  slider('modulationFrequency', 1, 600, 1);
  slider('modulationIndex', 1, 600, 1);
}

function loop() {

  carrier = time.map(sin(modulationFrequency)).mult(modulationIndex);
  signal = time.map(sin(signalFrequency, carrier));

  return signal.mult(0.1);
}
