blurb: |
  This is a called a comb filter, because of the shape of its frequency spectrum looks a bit like the teeth of a comb. Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character.

  Mathematically, a general [comb filter](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Comb_Filters.html) is of the form `input[t] + g1 * input[t - m1] - g2 * output[t - m2]`. If g1 = 0, this is called a [feedforward comb filter](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Feedforward_Comb_Filters.html), and if g2 = 0, this is called a [feedback comb filter](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Feedback_Comb_Filters.html).

  What happens if you change the delay?

function loop() {

  return noiseWave()
    .map(filter.apply)
    .mult(amp);
