title: High Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character. A high pass filter leaves high frequencies unaffected, and filters out low frequencies.

  It's defined like this:
  ```javascript
  const highPass = (b1, b2) => (input, output, i) => {
    return (b1 * input[i] - b2 * input[i - 1])
      || input[i];
  };
  ```
  This type of high pass filter is sometimes also referred to as a one-pole filter.

  Note if b1 = -b2 = 0.5, this becomes the [moving average](https://aatishb.com/synthfromscratch/examples/average/index.html).

let amp = 0.05;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(highPass(0.5, 0.5))
    .mult(amp);
}
