title: High Pass Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  A high pass filter leaves high frequencies unaffected, and filters out low frequencies. Filters are used to shape noise or other sounds, so that they become louder at some frequencies and softer at others. This gives the sound some added character. We can call it as `highPass(a)` where the parameter `a` is called the cutoff and can range between 0 and 1. This cutoff determines the frequency spectrum of the low pass filter.

  What happens to the spectrum as you change the cutoff?

  Mathematically, a high pass filter can be expressed as `output[i] = input[i] - a * output[i - 1]`. This type of high pass filter is sometimes also called a one-pole filter.

  So the highPass function is defined like this:
  ```javascript
  const highPass = (a) => (input, output, i) => {
    return (input[i] - a * output[i - 1])
      || input[i];
  };
  ```

let amp = 0.05;

}

function loop() {
  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(highPass(0.9))
    .mult(amp);
}
