blurb: |
  Distortion (or nonlinear distortion) is any efffect that changes the shape of a sine wave to something else. Distortion effects are used in electric guitar sounds and in simulating acoustic musical instruments. For example ,we use a nonlinear effect in the [flute](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/flute/index.html) example to model how the air in a flute interacts with the incoming breath pressure. You can read about other kinds of commonly used distortion [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Memoryless_Nonlinearities.html).

  In this example, we distort a sine wave with quadratic and cubic terms.

  What happens if instead of a single sine wave, we apply a nonlinear distortion to the sum of two sine waves? Notice how quadratic and cubic distortion have different effects on the sound spectrum.

let linear = 1, quadratic = 0, cubic = 0;

function setup() {
  slider('linear', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('quadratic', -0.5, 0.5, 0.01);
  slider('cubic', -0.5, 0.5, 0.01);
}

function loop() {
  return sinWave(440)
    .map(e => linear * e + quadratic * e * e + cubic * e*e*e)
    .mult(0.1);
}
