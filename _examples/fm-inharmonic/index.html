title: Inharmonic FM (bell)
category: modulation
blurb: |
  Here we're using FM synthesis to create inharmonic bell-like sounds. This example relies on the fact that 500/273 is not a simple ratio. We're slowly varying the modulation index as well, by amplitude modulating a triangle wave. This gives a more dynamic, changing sound.

let carrier, signal, mySine;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  mySine = time.map(triangle(0.5)).mult(5);

  carrier = time.map(sin(273)).modulate(mySine);
  signal = time.map(sin(500, carrier));

  return signal.mult(0.1);
}
