title: Inharmonic FM (bell)
category: modulation
blurb: |
  Here we're using FM synthesis to create inharmonic bell-like sounds. This example relies on the fact that 500/273 is not a simple ratio. We're slowly varying the modulation index as well, by amplitude modulating a triangle wave. This gives a more dynamic, changing sound.

let carrier, modulation;

function setup() {

}

function loop() {

  modulation = triWave(0.5).mult(5);
  carrier = sinWave(273).modulate(modulation);

  return sinWave(500, carrier).mult(0.1);
}
