blurb: |
  Here a set of harmonic overtones sound like a unified voice-like pitch with vibrato when all their frequencies are modulated by an amount proportional to their frequency.

  Add in a bunch of harmonics, and then increase the vibratoStrength. How does your perception of the sound change? This phenomenon also goes by the name [perceptual fusion](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.208.364&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
