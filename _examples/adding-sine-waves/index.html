title: Adding Sine Waves
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Three sine waves are added together to create a dial-tone like sound. This is a major triad, the lowest note is A4, and the next two are a major third (5/4 ratio) and perfect fifth (3/2 ratio) above.

  Can you make the sound into a minor chord? What happends when two of the notes are very close together?

let freq = 440, mult1 = 1.25, mult2 = 1.5;

function setup() {
  slider('freq', 50, 1000, 1);
  slider('mult1', 1, 2, 0.01);
  slider('mult2', 1, 2, 0.01);
}

function loop() {

  return sinWave(freq)
    .add(sinWave(mult1 * freq))
    .add(sinWave(mult2 * freq))
    .mult(0.1);
}
