blurb: |
  The delay function implements a delay of m samples. You can think of it like a tiny echo. This is one of the building blocks of sound synthesis. In this example, we recreate a comb filter using a delay.

  Delays are key to simulating the sounds of musical instruments, because when a sound wave travels down something like a string or a pipe, this travelling sound wave can be implemented as a delay.

let amp = 0.05;
let myWave;
let filter;

function setup() {
  filter = delay(10);
}

function loop() {
  myWave = noiseWave();
  myWave = myWave.map(filter.apply).sub(myWave);

  return myWave.mult(amp);
}
