title: Triangle Wave
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  A triangle wave climbs linearly from -1 to 1, and then descends linearly back to -1. Unlike the sawtooth wave or the square wave, the triangle wave has no sudden changes (no discontinuities), and this results in a less harsh sound with fewer high harmonics.
