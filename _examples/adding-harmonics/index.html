title: Adding Harmonics
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Harmonics are sine waves with frequencies that are integer multiples of a base frequency (f, 2f, 3f, 4f, ...). They correspond to the different ways that a musical instrument like a pipe or a string can resonate to produce sound. A surprising fact is that if you add enough harmonics together, you can re-create any wave shape! This is known as Fourier's Theorem, which you can read about [here](http://nautil.us/blog/the-math-trick-behind-mp3s-jpegs-and-homer-simpsons-face).

  Can you adjust the sliders to create a sawtooth wave? Once you have a sawtooth wave, remove the even-numbered harmonics to create a square wave.

let freq = 300;
let firstHarmonic = 1, secondHarmonic = 0, thirdHarmonic = 0,
  fourthHarmonic = 0, fifthHarmonic = 0;

function setup() {
  slider('firstHarmonic', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('secondHarmonic', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('thirdHarmonic', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('fourthHarmonic', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('fifthHarmonic', -1, 1, 0.01);
  slider('freq', 20, 1000, 1);
}

function loop() {

  return sinWave(freq).mult(firstHarmonic)
  .add(sinWave(2 * freq).mult(secondHarmonic))
  .add(sinWave(3 * freq).mult(thirdHarmonic))
  .add(sinWave(4 * freq).mult(fourthHarmonic))
  .add(sinWave(5 * freq).mult(fifthHarmonic))
  .mult(0.1);
}
