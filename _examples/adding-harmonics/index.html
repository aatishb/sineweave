title: Adding Harmonics
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  Harmonics are sine waves with frequencies that are integer multiples of a base frequency (f, 2f, 3f, 4f, ...). They correspond to the different ways that a musical instrument like a pipe or a string can resonate to produce sound. A surprising fact is that if you add enough harmonics together, you can re-create any wave shape! This is known as Fourier's Theorem, which you can read about [here](http://nautil.us/blog/the-math-trick-behind-mp3s-jpegs-and-homer-simpsons-face).

  Can you adjust the sliders to create a sawtooth wave? Once you have a sawtooth wave, remove the even-numbered harmonics to create a square wave.

  return wave1.add(wave2).add(wave3).add(wave4)
