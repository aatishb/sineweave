title: Square Wave
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  A square wave jumps from -1 to 1, and repeats itself at a given frequency.

  Because it contains a sudden jump (a discontinuity), there are lot of high frequency harmonics in the sound spectrum, resulting in a harsh, buzzy tone. One way to mitigate this is to synthesize a [band-limited square wave](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/square-bandlimited/index.html), by adding fewer [harmonics](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/adding-harmonics/index.html) to approximate the wave.

  Try adding two square waves of different frequencies together. Take a look at the [adding sine waves](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/adding-sine-waves/index.html) example to see how you can do this.

let freq = 440;

function setup() {
  slider('freq', 20, 600, 1);
}

function loop() {
  return sqrWave(freq).mult(0.05);
}
