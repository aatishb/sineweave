blurb: |
  The classic [Karplus-Strong Algorithm](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/MusicAndComputers/chapter4/04_09.php) for simulating the sound of a guitar string. Start with a random wave filled with white noise. Now loop a delay followed by a smoothing average.

  Try changing the frequency to something else.

let wave, average;

function setup() {
  wave = noiseWaveGuide(100);
  average = twoPointAverage();
}

function loop() {
  wave = wave.delay().apply(average);
  return wave.mult(0.1);
}
