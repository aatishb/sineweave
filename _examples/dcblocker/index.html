title: DC Block Filter
category: filter
blurb: |
  A DC blocker filter leaves higher frequencies unaffected, and filters out the lowest frequencies. This is used in the flute synthesis example to prevent the baseline of the waveform to drift as the output is fed back into the input.

  What happens to the spectrum as you change the cutoff?

let amp = 0.05;
let filter;

function setup() {
  filter = new dcBlocker(0.05);
}

function loop() {

  return time
    .map(whiteNoise)
    .applyFilter(filter)
    .mult(amp);
}
