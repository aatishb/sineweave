blurb: |
  A waveguide model of a flute, based on the model by Perry Cook described [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/compmus/clm-tutorials/pm.html#s-f) and [here](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.1992.072). Here the waveguide is implemented using Wave(), so the flute length or pitch can't be changed. For an adjustable flute length, we need to use a waveguide instead.
