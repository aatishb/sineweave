title: Damped Sine
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  This is a [sine wave](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/sine/index.html) whose amplitude decays exponentially.

  `sinDamped(frequency, timeConstant)` requires two arguments: the frequency of the wave, and the time constant, which determines the speed of the decay. If this is 1, it means the wave will shrink to 1/e (~ 37%) of its amplitude in 1 second.

  What happens to the sound as you make the time constant smaller?
