title: Damped Sine
category: oscillator
blurb: |
  This is a [sine wave](https://aatishb.com/synthesine/examples/sine/index.html) whose amplitude decays exponentially.

  `sinDamped(frequency, timeConstant)` requires two arguments: the frequency of the wave, and the time constant. If tau is 1, it means the wave will shrink to 1/e (~ 37%) of its height in 1 second.

  What happens to the sound as you make the time constant tau smaller?

let amp = 0.5;

function loop() {

    .map(sinDamped(freq, 1))
    .mult(amp);
}
