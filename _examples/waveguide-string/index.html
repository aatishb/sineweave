blurb: |
  The classic [Karplus-Strong Algorithm](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/MusicAndComputers/chapter4/04_09.php) for simulating the sound of a guitar string. Start with a random wave filled with white noise. Now loop a delay followed by a smoothing average.

  Try changing the frequency to something else.

let output, waveTable;
let freq = 500;
let average;

function setup() {
  let waveTableLength = Math.round(sampleRate / freq - 0.5);
  waveTable = new WaveTable(waveTableLength);
  waveTable.map(whiteNoise).map(e => 0.1 * e);
  average = twoPointAverage();
}

function loop() {

  waveTable.delay(128);
  output = waveTable.get().map(average.apply);
  waveTable.update(output);

  return output;
}
